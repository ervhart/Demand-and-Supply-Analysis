# Demand and Supply Analysis
This project involves the demand and supply concepts and how the relationship between the quantity demanded and the quantity supplied can be analyzed using Python.
The dataset used in this project can be found in this repository. Below is some basic information about the dataset:

 * Drivers Active Per Hour: Number of drivers active per hour
 * Rides Completed: Number of rides completed.
 * Riders Active Per Hour: Number of Riders looking for rides

# Probem Solves
The task is to analyze the demand for rides and the supply of taxis to understand demand and supply patterns.

# Properties Calculated:

* Relationship between the number of drivers active per hour and the number of rides active per hour
* Elasticity
* Supply Ratio
